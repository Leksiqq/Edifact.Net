0.   Introduction

This specification  provides the  definition of  the Customs
Declaration Message  (CUSDEC) to  be used in Electronic Data
Interchange   (EDI)    between    partners    involved    in
administration, commerce and transport.

1.   Scope

1.1  Functional Definition

This  Customs   Declaration  Message  (CUSDEC)  permits  the
transfer of   data  from    a  declarant    to  a    customs
administration for the purpose of meeting legislative and/or
operational  requirements in  respect of  the declaration of
goods for import, export or transit. The message may also be
used, for example :

- to  transmit data  from an  exporter in  one country to an
importer in another country;
- to   transmit  consignment    data  from    one    customs
administration to another;
- to  transmit  data  from  a  customs  authority  to  other
governments agencies and/or interested administrations.

1.2  Field of Application

This  Message   may  be   applied  for   both  national  and
international trade.  It is  based on universal practice and
is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3  Principles

This  message     incorporates   the  necessary   transport,
statistical and customs information. Provision has also been
made for the inclusion of appropriate commercial information
which may  be accepted  by customs  in  lieu  of  supporting
documentation.

The design  principles adopted  allow for referencing one or
more commercial documents pertaining to the same declaration
and for the grouping of document lines into a single customs
item.   A customs  item consists  of the  grouping of  those
document lines having the same customs characteristics (e.g.
tariff  number,   declared   use,   etc).      The   message
correspondingly permits the use of single or multi-packaging
concepts and their identification to a customs item.
