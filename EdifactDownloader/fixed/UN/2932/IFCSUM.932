 0.  Introduction

     This specification provides the definition of the
     International Forwarding and Consolidation Summary Message
     (IFCSUM) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
     between partners involved in Administration, Commerce and
     Transport.


 1.  Scope

 1.1 Functional Definition

     A message to be used for consolidation purposes from a
     party arranging forwarding and transport services to the
     party for which the transport of the consolidated cargo is
     destined.
     The message can be used to exchange information concerning
     the consolidated cargo between forwarders, carriers and
     agents enabling those parties to handle the consignments
     included in this consolidation.
     In addition it can be used for a collection of consignments
     originating from one shipper for forwarding and transport
     services.

 1.2 Field of Application

     This message may be applied for both national and
     international trade. It is based on universal practice and
     is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

 1.3 Principles

     The IFCSUM message is a functionality in its own right,
     distinguishable from the IFTMFR's functional messages such
     as booking and instruction for transport to be performed.
     IFCSUM focuses on separate business areas in transport
     where the view on the operations is transport means or
     equipment oriented rather than consignment oriented.
     These business areas do not concentrate on concepts like
     booking or instruction. The IFCSUM provides currently
     merely a statement for a means of transport or equipment
     and their summary type information regarding the
     consignment carried.
     The IFCSUM message also provides a means to incorporate the
     control and auditability information needed for the
     receiver of the message to perform the operation to be
     carried out.

     IFCSUM is foreseen to be used:
     -   in the consolidation and deconsolidation industry
     (stuffing and stripping of consignments in containers)
     -   in the groupage and degroupage industry (the full load
     description of rail-cars and road vehicles)
     -   in the collection and distribution industry (as the
     description of all consignments to be collected together
     (maybe from different places) and delivered at possibly
     different places in a certain region)
     -   for the declaration of dangerous cargo by ship's agents
     to their Port Authorities (as listing of the dangerous
     cargo carried or to be carried by as means of transport)

     The message provides information concerning cargo carried
     on a voyage specifying details regarding carrier, mode of
     transport, means of transport, equipment and the necessary
     details of the consignments included in the consolidated
     cargo.
     Under given circumstances a cargo manifest can be obtained
     through the use of the IFCSUM.
     For example, a IFCSUM message can be used in groupage
     traffic,
     where it may correspond to a loading list indicating the
     consignments that have been loaded on a truck.

     There is a need for FUNCTIONAL SUBSETS to be derived from
     the
     message, for example:

     -   CONSOLIDATION ADVICE giving information about the
     departure of a voyage/flight or consolidation to the
     receiver.

     -   CONSOLIDATION STATUS giving information about the
     departure of a voyage/flight or consolidation to principals
     (e.g. carrier to freight forwarder, consolidator to co-
     loader etc.).

     -   CONSOLIDATION REPORT giving information about the
     arrival and unloading, clearance, etc. from the receiver to
     the sender.

     According to the different information requirements of
     carriers, carrier's agents, and freight forwarders for the
     different modes of transport like air, deep sea, inland
     waterways, rail, road, combined- and/or multimodal-
     transport different modal subsets can be derived from this
     message.

     There is a need for INTRAMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted
     between
     partners of the same mode of transport (e.g. railway to
     railway in different countries, deep-sea-carrier to deep-
     sea carrier, freight forwarder to freight forwarder etc.).

     There is another need for INTERMODAL SUBSETS to be
     transmitted  between partners in a multimodal transport
     (e.g. freight
     forwarder to trucker, trucker to railway, railway to port
     authority, port authority to carrier's agent, carrier's
     agent to carrier etc.).

     -   A consignment may contain several goods items.

     -   Goods items may or may not be containerized.

     -   A goods item may be transported in one or more
     containers, and a single container may contain one or more
     goods items.

     -   One goods item may be related to one or more customs
     tariff codes.

     -   Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be
     carried in one or more containers.

     -   Goods items may reflect either the contractual or
     operational description of the goods.

     -   Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
     (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within
     one booking or instruction may take place in different
     steps, each step specified with its own transport details
     group.

     -   Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to
     it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a
     container.

     -   Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
     transported on another load or transport device, which as
     such may be attached to or transported on yet another load
     or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a
     rail-car.

     -   Transport devices, which have the ability of powered
     movement on their own, are specified in the transport
     details group. Other load or transport devices are
     specified as equipment.

     -   The expression of packaging for goods items can be
     expressed at up to three levels.

     A number of generic transport terms are used in this
     specification, to be described as:

     *   MODE OF TRANSPORT:
     the method of transport used for the conveyance of goods or
     persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.

     *   MEANS OF TRANSPORT:
     the vehicle used for the transport of goods or persons,
     e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.

     *   TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT:
     the type of vehicle used in the transport process, e.g.
     wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.

     *   EQUIPMENT:
     material resources necessary to facilitate the transport
     and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under the
     given circumstances not have the ability to move by its own
     propulsion (e.g. sea container, trailer, unit load device,
     pallet).

     *   TYPE OF EQUIPMENT:
     the type of material used, e.g. 40 feet container, four way
     pallet, mafi trailer.

     ULD, etc.).
     This segment group WILL NOT be used in the deep sea
     context.  This is because EQD in this context is used to
     define an extended transport such as a trailer attached to
     a truck, containers attached to a trailer etc.
     Containers in the deep sea context ARE NOT part of an
     extended definition of transport but are considered as integral
     with the consignment and are thus described at the consignment
     level using the IFTM-structure.

       EQD, Equipment details
       A segment to specify equipment, and equipment size and
       type used for the transport of the consolidation.

       equipment named in segment EQD which are not indicated
       in the segment EQD.

       DIM, Dimensions

       with the    equipment named in segment EQD.

       NAD, Name and address
       A segment to specify parties associated with the
       equipment named in segment EQD (e.g. owner of the
       equipment, party to which the empty equipment has to be
       delivered etc.).

       LOC, Place/location identification
       A segment to specify locations associated with the
       party and/or the equipment.

       FTX, Free text
       A segment to specify processable instructions
       associated with
       the equipment named in segment EQD (e.g. instructions
       related to the delivery of the empty equipment after
       unloading of the consignments etc.).

       Segment group 14: EQA-EQN
       A group of segments to identify attached or related
       equipment.

         EQA, Attached equipment
         A segment to identify attached and/or related
         equipment such as chassis attached to a container.

         EQN, Number of units
         A segment to specify the number of pieces of
         equipment named in the segment EQA attached to the
         equipment named in the segment EQD.

     Segment group 15: CNI-SGP-CTA-COM-DTM-TSR-CUX-MOA-FTX-
	SG16-SG17-SG18-SG19-SG21-SG22-SG23-SG25-SG31-SG49
     A segment group to give information about all consignments
     included in a voyage/flight or consolidation.
     The segment group can be used in two different manners to
     serve different approaches to consolidate messages:

     - Short form consolidation message

     In this situation, IFTMFR-derived functional messages about
     individual consignments have been sent on a progressive
     basis between exchanging partners (e.g. freight forwarder
     on the export side to freight forwarder on the import
     side).
     When the loading of the vessel/aircraft or consolidation is
     complete the IFCSUM-message will be sent and will use the
     CNI-segments to identify the transport document/message
     number (e.g. bill of lading, air-way bill, etc.) of every
     consignment, the details of which have already been sent as
     separate IFTMFR-derived functional messages or which will
     be sent as separate IFTMFR-derived functional messages
     following the IFCSUM-message using the option of grouping
     with the UNG-service-segment in a transmission.
     When the carrier himself loads consignments in a container
     or ULD
     the segment SGP following the CNI can be used to indicate
     in which equipment specified in the segment group 10 the
     consignment is loaded.

     Thus the short form IFCSUM-message operates as a
     reconciliation and control statement.

     - Extended form consolidation message

     In this situation, the data for each individual consignment
     has NOT been sent to the receiving partner by means of
     IFTMFR-derived functional messages separate to the IFCSUM
     message. In these circumstances it is possible to include
     the IFTMFR-derived details of each consignment into the
     IFCSUM-message. In that
     case the segment SGP following the segment CNI will not be
     used.   For every consignment the complete structure of the
     IFTMFR can be used starting with the segment CNI replacing
     the BGM.

     Thus the extended form IFCSUM-message has not the function
     of referencing but to show as full a set of consignment
     data as is necessary to meet the requirements of type of
     consolidation message being constructed, e.g. Cargo vs.
     Full Freight.

       CNI, Consignment information
