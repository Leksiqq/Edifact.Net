0.  Introduction

    This specification  provides the definition of Delivery
    Just In  Time Message (DELJIT) to be used in Electronic
    Data Interchange  (EDI) between  partners  involved  in
    administration, commerce and transport.

1.   Scope

1.1  Functional Definition

     A message provides the ability for a customer to convey
     precise delivery  sequence and  Just In  Time  schedule
     requirements  to   a  supplier,   and  is  intended  to
     supplement the Delivery Schedule Message (DELFOR).

1.2  Field of Application

     The UN  Standard Delivery  Just In  Time Message may be
     applied to  national and  international trade.   It  is
     based on  universal  commercial  practice  and  is  not
     dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3  Principles

     The use of this message will facilitate the practice of
     Just In  Time (JIT)  delivery by providing the customer
     with a  mechanism to  issue precise  shipping  schedule
     requirements in  terms of a 24 hour clock and on a more
     frequent basis  than with  the instance  of a  delivery
     schedule message,  e.g. daily shipping schedules versus
     weekly planning schedules.

                 Introduction, Section 2.

4.   Message Definition

     This section  is provided  to  give  clarification  and
     further explanation to the usage of segments within the
     message structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

     This section  should be  read in  conjunction with  the
     Branching Diagram  and  Segment  Table  which  indicate
     mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

     The following  guidelines and  principles apply  to the
     whole  message  and  are  intended  to  facilitate  the
     understanding and implementation of the message:

     All specified  dates/times  should  be  in  the  format
     'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless  all  parties  involved  in  the
     transaction  agree   that   there   is   a   functional
     requirement for an alternative format.
     Periods  should   be   specified   as   whole   numbers
     representing the  required period  as indicated  in the
     format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)

     Where a  choice of  code or text is given only the code
     element should be used wherever possible.

     Conditional data  that is  not required  in the message
     should not be included.

     Care must  be  taken  that  the  segment  qualifier  in
     dependent segments  do not  conflict with  the  segment
     qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.

     Free text  information within  the  message  should  be
     avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

     4.1.1 Heading section

     Information to be provided in the Heading Section:

     UNH, Message header
     A service segment starting and uniquely identifying a message.

     Note: Delivery just in time messages conforming to this document
           must contain the following data in UNH, composite S009:

           Data element   0065   DELJIT
                          0052   1
                          0054   911
                          0051   UN

     BGM, Beginning of message
     A segment for unique identification of the document name and
     its number.

     DTM, Date/time/period
     A segment  specifying  the  date  and,  when  relevant,  the
     time/period for  delivery of  that sequence, relating to the
     whole message.   The  DTM segment must be specified at least
     once to identify the Delivery Just In Time document date.

     The date/time/period  segment  within  other  Segment  group
     should be  used whenever the date/time/period requires to be
     logically related to another specified data item.

     Segment group 1: RFF-DTM
     A group  of segments  giving references only relevant to the
     specified party rather than the whole message, e.g. contract
     number.

       RFF, Reference
       A segment  for referencing  documents to the whole message,
       e.g. contract, import/export license.

       DTM, Date/time/period
       Date/time/period as applied the referred document.

     Segment group 2: NAD-LOC-FTX-SG3
     A group  of segments  identifying names  and  addresses  and
     their functions relevant for the whole Delivery just in time
     message.

       NAD, Name and address
       A segment  for identifying  names and  addresses and  their
       functions relevant  for the  whole Delivery  just  in  time
       message.  Identification of the seller and buyer parties is
       recommended for  the Delivery just in time message. They are
       to be given in the NAD segment.

       It is  recommended that  where possible only the coded form
       of the  party ID  should be  specified. e.g.  The Buyer and
       Seller are  known to  each other, thus only the coded ID is
       required, but  the Consignee  or Delivery  address may vary
       and would  have to  be  clearly  specified,  preferably  in
       structured format.

       LOC, Place/location identification
       A  segment   indicating  more  details  regarding  specific
       place/locations related  to the  party specified in the NAD
       segment, e.g. internal site/building number.

       FTX, Free text
       A segment  with free  text in  coded or clear form, to give
       further clarification, when required, about the party.
       In computer  to computer  exchanges such text will normally
       require the receiver to process this segment manually.

       Segment group 3: CTA-COM
       A  group   of  segments   to  identify   person,  function,
       department and  appropriate numbers  to whom  communication
       should be directed.

         CTA, Contact information
         A segment  to identify  person, function,  department  to
         whom communication should be directed.

         COM, Communication contact
         Identify communication  types  and  numbers  for  person,
         function, department identified in CTA.
