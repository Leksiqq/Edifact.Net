0.   Introduction
 
This specification provides the definition of the
International Forwarding and Transport Message Framework
to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between
partners involved in Administration, Commerce and
Transport.
 
1.   Scope
 
This paper provides the definition of the International
Forwarding and Transport Message (IFTM) framework to be
used for the development of functional messages to fulfil
the requirements of trading partners in the transport
chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and
transport related information using Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI).

The IFTM framework is intended to be a hierarchical
representation of all information needed to perform the
forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any
destination regardless of route, modes of transport, or
prevailing commercial practice.  Functional  messages
derived from the IFTM framework are suitable for the
arrangement of the transport of goods between all parties
to the movement of the consignment  (including the
consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the
forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as
providing the information necessary to perform that
transport and delivery of the goods.

The framework is suitable for all modes of transport or
combinations of modes of transport in international
forwarding and transport.  The framework has been
designed to cover the information needs for the varied
aspects of the forwarding and transport of goods, e.g.
booking, waybill, bill of lading, arrival, ordering, and
contract status.

1.1  Functional Definition

At the time of publication of this version and release of
the framework, six functional messages have been derived
from the IFTM framework. This is not the final list of
functional messages, and it may be added to in future as
commercial needs dictate. A code for each functional
message to be derived is indicated.

     IFTM as Booking, Provisional (code IFTMBP):
     A message from a party requesting space and/or
     giving brief details of a planned consignment for
     forwarding and/or transport services to the party
     providing those services. In this message, the conditions
     under which the planned transport should take place can
     be given. 

     IFTM as Booking, Firm (code IFTMBF):
     A message from a party definitely booking forwarding
     and/or transport services to the party providing those
     services. The message will contain the conditions under
     which the sender of the messages requires the services to
     take place.

     IFTM as Booking, Confirmation (code IFTMBC):
     A message from the party providing forwarding and/or
     transport services to the party booking those services,
     giving the confirmation information to the booking of the
     consignment concerned.
     A confirmation might read that the booking of a
     consignment is accepted, pending, conditionally accepted
     or rejected.
     The conditions under which requested services take
     place may be given in this message.

     IFTM as Instruction (code IFTMIN):
     A message from the party issuing an instruction
     regarding forwarding transport services for a consignment
     under conditions agreed, to the party arranging the
     forwarding and/or transport services.

     IFTM as Instruction Contract Status (code IFTMCS):
     A message from the party providing the
     transport/forwarding services to the party that issued
     the instructions for those services stating the actual
     details, terms and conditions (charges when applicable)
     of the service and of the consignment involved.
     In addition it can be used for the exchange of
     contract information between carriers mutually.

     IFTM as Arrival Notice (code IFTMAN):
     A message from the party providing forwarding and/or
     transport services, to the party such as has been
     indicated in the contract,  giving notice and details of
     the arrival of the consignment.

NOTE: In addition, it is expected that the IFTM will
provide a basis for having the capability for associating
one consignment with another.

     A typical sequence of functional messages in the
     different stages of the transaction between trading
     partners is depicted below.

1.2            Field of Application

The UN International Forwarding and Tranport Message
(IFTM) framework may be applied for both national and
international trade. It is based on universal practice
and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.
The functional messages derived from the IFTM framework
are useable by all modes of transport, examples of which
are, but are not limited to: air, barge, courier, deep-
sea, pipeline, rail, road, and short-sea.  IFTM should
therefore be used in the same way by each mode of
transport when the requirements are common even if
functionally similar information is known by different
names.

MESSAGES IN THE FRAMEWORK AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
The IFTM  framework is designed to handle the total
information necessary for the forwarding and transport of
any consignment regardless of origin, destination, or
mode of transport. Historically, this total acitivity has
been handled with a number of paper documents each
covering an individual activity along the route.These
paper documents, however, contain much repetitive
information.  The theory behind the IFTM framework is to
provide a single  EDI data format that will include all
of this information without redundancy.  Therefore while
the IFTM framework is to be treated as a single EDI
format it contains elements that will provide the
information that has previously been handled with
multiple paper documents.

The entire IFTM framework can be transmitted between all
parties to the movement of the consignment in turn along
its route. Derivations of the IFTM can be used to
transmit information pertaining to specific
functionalities which have been incorporated into the
entire framework.  Examples of these functional messages
include, but are not limited to: provisional bookings,
consignment status responses, waybill data, changes to
previously transmitted  messages, etc.

1.3  Principles

-    A consignment may contain several goods items.

-    Goods items may or may not be containerized.

-    A goods item may be transported in one or more
containers, and a single container may contain one or
more goods items.

-    One goods item may be related to one or more customs
tariff codes.

-    Goods items related to one customs tariff code may
be carried in one or more containers.

-    Goods items may reflect either the contractual or
operational description of the goods.

-    A party to the movement of the consignment may book
or order transport  for one or more goods items.

-    A party to the movement of the consignment may book
or issue instructions of transport to be arranged for
several goods items by means of one or several of the
following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN,
IFTMCS, IFTMAN.

-    Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage
(destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within
one booking or instruction may take place in different
steps, each step specified with its own transport details
group.

-    Equipment may have other types of equipment attached
to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a
container.

-    Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or
transported on another load or transport device, which as
such may be attached to or transported on yet another
load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis
on a railcar.

-    Transport devices, which have the ability of powered
movement on their own, are specified in the transport
details group. Other load or transport devices are
specified as equipment.

-    The expression of packaging for goods items can be
expressed at up to three levels.

     A number of generic transport terms are used in this
specification, to be described as:

     *    MODE OF TRANSPORT:
the method of transport used for the conveyance of goods
or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.

     *    MEANS OF TRANSPORT:
the vehicle used for the transport of goods or persons,
e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.

     *    TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT:
the type of vehicle used in the transport process, e.g.
wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.

     *    EQUIPMENT:     
material resources necessary to facilitate the transport
and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under the
given circumstances not have the ability to move by its
own propulsion (e.g. sea container, trailer, unit load
device, pallet).

     *    TYPE OF EQUIPMENT:  
the type of material used, e.g. 40 feet container, four
way pallet, mafi trailer.

4.   Message Definition

This section is provided to give clarification and
further explanation to the usage of segments within the
framework structure.

Segments are, in general, defined to be applicable over a
wide range of messages. However, certain restrictions may
apply according to the function of the segment within the
structure.

The framework is designed to be used in and across
different industries and applications for both national
and international exchange.  To meet these requirements
several segments and segment groups are defined as
conditional.  It is important , therefore , that users
intending to use the framework first study each
conditional segment and segment group to decide which are
necessary for their particular application.

The logical sequence of the segments transmitted in the
International Forwarding and Transport Message is un-
ambiguous and needs no additional control information.
Explicit indication of repeating segments is hence
unnecessary and implicit indication of repeating segments
(implicit nesting) is therefore mandatory for the
International Forwarding and Transport Message Framework.

Message Structure Branching Diagram and Segment Table
