0.   Introduction

This  paper  provides  the  definition  of  the  Price/Sales
Catalogue Message  (PRICAT) to  be used  in Electronic  Data
Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.


1.   Scope

1.1  Functional Definition

A  message   to  enable   the  transmission  of  information
regarding  pricing  and  catalogue  details  for  goods  and
services offered by a seller to a buyer.

1.2  Field of Application

The UN Standard Price/Sales Catalogue Message may be applied
for both  national and  international trade.  It is based on
universal commercial  practice and  is not  dependent on the
type of business or industry.

1.3  Principles

- A  Price/Sales Catalogue Message Pricing-group or item may
refer to either goods items or services.

- The  Price items  are  structured  together  according  to
industrial or commercial requirements.

- The  sales and  delivery conditions  within a  Price/Sales
Catalogue Message may refer to:

. all  product/service items  of the  Price/Sales  Catalogue
Message,

. a group of product/service items,

. a single product/service item in the message,

. within  a single  product/service item  to different price
basis occurrences.

- A  Price/Sales Catalogue  Message may  contain product and
price information, as well as sales conditions.

- The  Price Item  Line may  identify the component parts of
the price item.

4.   Message Definition

This section  is provided  to give clarification and further
explanation to  the usage  of segments  within  the  message
structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This  section   should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Branching  Diagram   and  Segment   Table   which   indicate
mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

The following  guidelines and  principles apply to the whole
message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
implementation of the message:

All  specified   dates/times  should   be  in   the   format
'yymmdd'/'hhmm'  unless   all  parties   involved   in   the
transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for
an alternative format.

Periods should  be specified  as whole  numbers representing
the required  period as  indicated in  the  date/time/period
format (weeks, months, etc.).

Conditional data  that is not required in the message should
not be included.

Care must  be taken  that the segment qualifier in dependent
segments do  not conflict  with the segment qualifier of the
trigger segment of the group

Free text  information within  the message should be avoided
as this inhibits automatic processing.
