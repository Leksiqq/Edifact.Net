0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Government Cross
       Border Regulatory message (GOVCBR) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

       The GOVCBR message may be used for both national and international
       applications. It is based on universal practices related to
       administration, commerce and transport, and it is not dependant on
       the type of business or industry.

1.1    Functional definition

       In relation to cross-border transactions, the Government Cross
       Border Regulatory message (GOVCBR) permits a Declarant  to submit a
       legally required declaration or other regulatory information to a
       cross-border regulatory agency (B2G) typically operating in a Single
       Window environment. 
       It also permits the transfer of response data from a cross-border
       regulatory agency to the Declarant2 (G2B). 
       It further permits cross border regulatory agencies to share
       information included in the declaration among national and
       international government agencies (G2G).
       In all three scenarios of B2G, G2B and G2G, the GOVCBR is meant to
       be used in relation to Import, Export or Transit processes for the
       following functions, either separately or in combination: 
       - the declaration of goods;
       - the reporting of cargo;
       - the reporting of transport equipment and conveyance;
       - the reporting of crew.

1.2    Field of application

       The Government Cross Border Regulatory message may be used for both
       national and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is
       not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       -	This message incorporates information on goods, cargo, transport
       equipment, conveyance and crew that is legally required for cross-
       border transactions to be sent to cross-border regulatory agencies
       and allows these agencies to respond to a declaration. It can also
       be used for sending this information from one Cross-Border
       Regulatory Agency to another.
       -	GOVCBR may be submitted by the declarant to a single window
       environment progressively in stages to fulfil all functions listed
       in 1.1 above and to fulfil all data requirements of a cross-border
       regulatory agency. GOVCBR is specially designed to enable re-use
       information that is submitted in different stages of cross-border
       regulatory reporting.
       -	Provision has been made for the inclusion of appropriate
       information which may be accepted by the relevant cross-border
       regulatory agencies in lieu of supporting documentation.
       -	It is envisaged that within the cargo reporting area the GOVCBR
       can also be used for reporting on transport equipment and ships
       stores. 
       -	With regard  to the reporting on the conveyance the GOVCBR
       embodies reporting requirements of all modes of transport whereby
       each message covers the data requirements for one conveyance. 
       -	The message may be used for reporting empty containers as well as
       numbers of passengers and crew and conveyance security
       requirements. 
       -	The message may be used for advance reporting of pre-arrival
       information on cargo and conveyances.
       -	The GOVCBR message also accommodates reporting of minimum data for
       simplified/expedited procedures, aggregated data for periodic
       reporting, or full details for an individual transaction.
       -	The GOVCBR design principles accommodate single or multiple
       consignments and is also to be used for a small collection of data
       (mini message) and a combined use of information on several
       aforementioned areas (compound message). 
       -	It also allows for referencing one or more commercial documents
       pertaining to the same declaration and for the grouping of document
       lines into a single cross-border regulatory agency item.
