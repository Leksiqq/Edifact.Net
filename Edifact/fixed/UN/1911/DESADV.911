Advice Message  (DESADV)  to  be  used  in  Electronic  Data

1.2  Field of Application

universal commercial  practice and  is not  dependent on the
type of business or industry.

1.3  Principles

a consignment.

The message  relates to  one seller  and one  buyer or their
respective agents.

This message relates to a single despatch point and single or
multiple destination  points.   It  may  cover  a  number  o
different items or packages.

It allows the recipient to:

-     know when  the material  has been despatched or will be
      ready for despatch

-    have the precise details of the consignment

-    take initial steps towards Customs clearance in case of
     international consignments.

-    enable  matching  between  despatched  goods  with  the
     following invoice.

4.   Message Definition

This section  is provided  to give clarification and further
explanation to  the usage  of segments  within  the  message
structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This  section   should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Branching  Diagram   and  Segment   Table   which   indicate
mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

The following  guidelines and  principles apply to the whole
message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
implementation of the message:

All  specified   dates/times  should   be  in   the   format
'yymmdd'/'hhmm'  unless   all  parties   involved   in   the
transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for
an alternative format. Periods should  be specified  as whole
numbers representing the required  period as  indicated in  the
format  qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)

Where a  choice of  code or  text is  given  only  the  code
element should be used wherever possible.

Conditional data  that is not required in the message should
not be included.

Care must  be taken  that the segment qualifier in dependent
segments do  not conflict  with the segment qualifier of the
trigger segment of a group.

Free text  information within  the message should be avoided
as this inhibits automatic processing.
