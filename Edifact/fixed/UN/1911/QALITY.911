0.   Introduction

This specification  provides the  definition of  the Quality
Data  Message   (QALITY)  to  be  used  in  Electronic  Data
Interchange   (EDI)    between    partners    involved    in
administration, commerce and transport.


1.   Scope

1.1  Functional Definition

A message to enable the transmission of the results of tests
performed  to   satisfy  a   specified  product  or  process
requirement.   The content  includes, but is not limited to,
test data and measurements, statistical information, and the
testing methods employed.

1.2  Field of Application

The UN Standard Quality Data Message may be applied for both
national and  international trade.  It is based on universal
commercial practice  and is  not dependent  on the  type  of
business or industry.

1.3  Principles

-    A Quality  Data Message detail line may refer to either
     goods items or services.

-    The values within a Quality Data Message may refer to:

.    a product/service,
.    a product via batch references,
.    process type information of a product.

-    A  Quality   Data  Message   may  contain  discrete  or
     statistical values as well as product specification values.


2.   References

Introduction, Section 1.


3.   Terms and Definitions

Introduction, Section 2.


4.   Message Definition
This section  is provided  to give clarification and further
explanation to  the usage  of segments  within  the  message
structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This  section   should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Branching  Diagram   and  Segment   Table   which   indicate
mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

The following  guidelines and  principles apply to the whole
message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
implementation of the message:

All  specified   dates/times  should   be  in   the   format
'yymmdd'/'hhmm'  unless   all  parties   involved   in   the
transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for
an alternative format.
Periods should  be specified  as whole  numbers representing
the required  period as  indicated in  the format  qualifier
(weeks, months, etc.)

Where a  choice of  code or  text is  given  only  the  code
element should be used wherever possible.

Conditional data  that is not required in the message should
not be included.

Care must  be taken  that the segment qualifier in dependent
segments do  not conflict  with the segment qualifier of the
trigger segment of a group.

Free text  information within  the message should be avoided
as this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1  Heading Section
