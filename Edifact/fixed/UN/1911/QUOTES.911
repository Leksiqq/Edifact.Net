0.  Introduction

This specification provides the definition of the United Nations
Standard Quotation Message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI) between trading partners, involved in administration, commerce
and transport.


1.  Scope

1.1 Functional Definition

A message which provides potential sellers with the ability to provide
price, delivery schedule, and other conditions for potential sales of
goods or services.

1.2 Field of Application

The UN Standard Quotation Message may be applied for both the national
and international trade.  It is based on universal commercial practice
and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3 Principles

- A potential seller may offer one or more goods items   or services.

- A quotation may refer to goods items or services   related to one or
  more delivery schedules, call-offs,    etc.

- A quotation for cross border transactions may   contain additional
  information for customs and/or    statistical purposes.


2.  References

See UNTDID, Part 4, Section 2.5 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
Section 1.


3.  Terms and Definitions

See UNTDID, Part 4, Section 2.5 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction,
Section 2.


4.  Message Definition

This section is provided to give clarification and further
explanation to the usage of segments within the message structure.
4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This section should be read in conjunction with the Branching Diagram
and Segment Table which indicate mandatory, conditional and repeating
requirements.

The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and
are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the
message:

All specified  dates/times should be in the format 'yymmdd'/'hhmm'
unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a
functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be
specified as whole numbers representing the required period as
indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)

Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should
be used wherever possible.

Data that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of the
message should not be included.

Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do
not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment.

Free text information within the message should be avoided as this
inhibits automatic processing.
