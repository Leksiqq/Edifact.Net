0.   Introduction

This specification provides the definition of the Delivery Schedule
Message (DELFOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
between partners involved in administration, commerce and
transportation.

1.   Scope

This paper  provides the  definition of  the United  Nations
Standard Delivery  Schedule message to be used in Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.

1.1  Functional Definition

A message from buyer to supplier giving product requirements
regarding  details  for  short  term  delivery  instructions
and/or medium  to long  term  product/service  forecast  for
planning purposes  according to  conditions  set  out  in  a
contract or order.  The message can be used to authorize the
commitment of labour and materials resources.

1.2  Field of Application

The UN Standard Delivery Schedule Message may be applied for
both national  and international  trade.   It  is  based  on
universal commercial  practice and  is not  dependent on the
type of business or industry.

1.3  Principles

- specify delivery schedules requested by the buyer

-   define    the   aspects   that   guarantee   a   perfect
synchronization between buyer and seller

- provide information allowing the seller to plan for future
requirements to  purchase  raw  materials,  to  produce  and
deliver goods in the most economical way.

4.   Message Definition

This section  is provided  to give clarification and further
explanation to  the usage  of segments  within  the  message
structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This  section   should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Branching  Diagram   and  Segment   Table   which   indicate
mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

The following  guidelines and  principles apply to the whole
message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
implementation of the message:

All  specified   dates/times  should   be  in   the   format
'yymmdd'/'hhmm'  unless   all  parties   involved   in   the
transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for
an alternative format.

Periods should  be specified  as whole  numbers representing
the required  period as  indicated in  the format  qualifier
(weeks, months, etc.)

Where a  choice of  code or  text is  given  only  the  code
element should be used wherever possible.

Conditional data  that is not required in the message should
not be included.

Care must  be taken  that the segment qualifier in dependent
segments do  not conflict  with the segment qualifier of the
trigger segment of a group.

Free text  information within  the message should be avoided
as this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1     Heading section

period of  the document.  The DTM must be specified at least
