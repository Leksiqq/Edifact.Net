0.   Introduction

This specification  provides the  definition of  the  United
Nations Standard  Invoice Message  to be  used in Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners, involved in
administration, commerce and transport.


1.   Scope

1.1  Functional Definition

A message  claiming payment  for goods  or services supplied
under conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.

The United  Nations Standard  Invoice Message,  with correct
data qualification,  serves also  as the  specification  for
Debit Note and Credit Note messages.

Throughout this  document, the reference to 'Invoice' may be
interpreted   as    conveying   the    wider   meaning    of
'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.

1.2  Field of Application

The UN  Standard Invoice  Message may  be applied  for  both
national and  international trade.  It is based on universal
commercial practice  and is  not dependent  on the  type  of
business or industry.

1.3  Principles

-    A seller may invoice for one or more transactions.

-    An invoice may refer to goods items or services related
     to one or more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.

-    An invoice may contain references to payment terms.

-    An invoice for cross border transactions may contain additional
     information for customs and/or statistical purposes/services.

-    An invoice may contain transport details.

Introduction, Section 1.


3.   Terms and Definitions

Introduction, Section 2.


4.   Message Definition

This section  is provided  to give clarification and further
explanation to  the usage  of segments  within  the  message
structure.

4.1  Data Segment Clarification

This  section   should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
Branching  Diagram   and  Segment   Table   which   indicate
mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.

The following  guidelines and  principles apply to the whole
message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
implementation of the message:

All  specified   dates/times  should   be  in   the   format
'yymmdd'/'hhmm'  unless   all  parties   involved   in   the
transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for
an alternative format.
Periods should  be specified  as whole  numbers representing
the required  period as  indicated in  the format  qualifier
(weeks, months, etc.)

Where a  choice of  code or  text is  given  only  the  code
element should be used wherever possible.

Conditional data  that is not required in the message should
not be included.

Care must  be taken  that the segment qualifier in dependent
segments do  not conflict  with the segment qualifier of the
trigger segment of a group.

Free text  information within  the message should be avoided
as this inhibits automatic processing.

4.1.1     Heading section
